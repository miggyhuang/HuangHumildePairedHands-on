        <h1>This Man Thinks I'm Anna, But I'm Not</h1>
        <h2>From: r/shortscarystories</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="bg1">
        <p id="p1">My eyes open, but there’s nothing to see. Darkness and confinement surround me in what feels like a coffin. Legs bound, arms restrained, mouth gagged. No idea how I ended up here.</p>
        <p id="p2">I fight against the restraints, desperately hoping for something to snap and release me. It's pointless. </p>
        <p id="p3">Footsteps draw closer, until they stop nearby. The surface in front of me creaks open like a door, and the room's light blinds me.</p>
        <p id="p4">As my vision improves, I see a man standing before me, staring with meticulous interest.</p>
        <p id="p5">“Good afternoon, Anna,” he says. “I’ve watched you for so long. Seen you countless times leaving your house, going to the store, to work, to the gym…”</p>
        <p id="p6">“But now, you’re mine,” he finishes. And on his face, a terrifying smile spreads.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg2">
        <p id="p7">I try to scream, to tell him something’s wrong—that I’m not Anna. But the gag muffles every sound I make.</p>
        <p id="p8"><span id="bg1">Who is Anna?</span></p>
        <p id="p9">He steps out of sight, and I hear him handling something across the room. Then a shrill, piercing sound erupts.</p>
        <p id="p10">The man reappears with a drill in one hand and pliers in the other.</p>
        <p id="p11">What he did to my body was terrible and unending. Every inch of me burned with pain until everything went dark.</p>
        <p id="p12">And my eyes opened again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg3">
        <p id="p13">I’m lying on a metal bed, still in shock from the agony. Wires trail from my nose and ears. A woman in a lab coat approaches and removes them.</p>
        <p id="p14">“You may get up, Mr. Elliot,” she tells me. My body is intact.</p>
        <p id="p15">I rise, questioning her about what I had just experienced.</p>
        <p id="p16"><span id="bg2">“What you witnessed was the murder of Anna Bauer, which occurred in September 2034,” she informs me. “You killed her in the attic of your residence, and reliving the event is part of your sentence.”</span></p>
        <p id="p17">I catch my reflection in a metallic surface and recognize the face of the one who caused my suffering earlier.</p>
        <p id="p18">“What she went through… was horrific,” I tell her, tears streaming down my face.</p>
        <p id="p19">She offers a sympathetic smile. “It’s common to feel that way after this procedure, Mr. Elliot,” she confides. “But as soon as you're ready, we’ll need to proceed to the next operation. “There are still twelve girls left.”</p>
        <p id="p20">The End</p>
        </div>
        <p id="p21"> ...or is it?</p>
